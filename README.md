Title: Car Price Predictor - Machine Learning Project

Project Overview:
In this machine learning project, I developed a Car Price Predictor utilizing a dataset containing various features such as car specifications, location, and pricing information. The primary objective was to create a robust model capable of predicting car prices based on the provided features.

Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Conducted a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, identifying key features and understanding the data distribution.
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data integrity.
Feature Engineering:

Engineered new features to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.
Extracted relevant information from existing columns to provide additional insights.
Data Visualization:

Utilized data visualization techniques to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (car price).
Created visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices to understand feature importance.
Data Transformation:

Applied transformations to make key columns follow a normal distribution, optimizing the data for modeling.
Ensured that the data met the assumptions of various machine learning algorithms.
Pipeline Creation:

Built a robust data processing pipeline using Scikit-learn, which included encoding categorical variables and standardizing all columns.
The pipeline ensured consistency and efficiency when applying transformations to new data.
Model Training:

Trained the car price prediction model using multiple algorithms, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest.
Calculated evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), confusion matrix, and classification report for each model.
Deployment with Streamlit:

Deployed the machine learning model using the Streamlit framework, providing an interactive web interface for users to input car specifications and receive predicted prices.
Streamlit allowed for easy integration, creating a user-friendly and accessible deployment.
Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and modeling
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
Streamlit for web application development and deployment

Conclusion:
This project showcases my proficiency in end-to-end machine learning development, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment. The Streamlit interface provides a practical demonstration of how the developed model can be utilized in a real-world scenario.
